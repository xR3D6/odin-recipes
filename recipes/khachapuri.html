    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>75ml (1/3 cup) warm milk, heated to 43°C or 110°F</li>
        <li>2g (1/2 teaspoon) active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>15ml (1 tablespoon) sunflower oil</li>
        <li>200g (7oz or 1 2/3 cup) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>8g (1 teaspoon) salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>200g (7oz) Imeruli cheese,* grated</li>
      <li>150g (3.5 oz) Sulguni cheese,* grated</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, whisk yeast into milk until dissolved. Set aside until slightly foamy and very fragrant, about 5-10 minutes. Whisk in egg and oil until well combined. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour and salt. Make a well in the centre and pour in wet ingredients. Using a wooden spoon or silicone spatula, stir until a dry, shaggy dough forms. Turn out onto a clean work surface and knead until the dough become smooth, supple and is just barely tacky, about 5-10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic or a damp tea towel and move to a warm place. Let rise until doubled in size, about one hour.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Filling & Assembly</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 220C/425F</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine the Imeruli cheese, 100 grams of the sulguni cheese and the egg. Mix to combine and set aside.</li>
        <li>Gently punch down your dough and turn it out into a lightly floured work surface. Roll the dough in a circular shape until it reaches about 25 centimetres (10 inches) in diameter. Pile the filling into the centre, patting it into a disk and leaving a 5-centimetre (3-inch) perimeter of dough around the edges. Pleat the dough around the filling, pinching it to seal the filling completely.</li>
        <li>Gently roll the khachapuri out, ensuring the filling is completely sealed in until it reaches about 35 centimetres (14 inches) in diameter. Cut a small steam vent in the centre of the khachapuri.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining 50 grams of sulguni over the khachapuri.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake until cheese is melted and the khachapuri is puffed and lightly golden brown, about 10-15 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack and allow to cool for about five minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <q>If you can't find Imeruli or sulguni cheese, substitute an equal amount of feta for the Imeruli and low moisture, whole-milk mozzarella for the sulguni</q>
